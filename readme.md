**Theory Name:** Temporal Identity Loop Theory (TILT)

---

**Abstract:**
Temporal Identity Loop Theory (TILT) posits that time travel is not the act of physically moving backward or forward in time, but instead the deterministic relocation of consciousness into a distinct, pre-existing snapshot of the universe. These snapshots are treated as isolated universal instances, and time travel results in a recursive self-overwriting of identity. The traveler does not observe the past—they *become* their past self, perfectly re-integrated into the original state, thus causing an inescapable deterministic time loop with no origin and no memory continuity.

**Key Tenets of TILT:**

1. **Time as Discrete Universal States**

   * Each moment in time is a complete universe (U\_t), with all physical states fixed and immutable.
   * Movement through time is a transition of consciousness from one universe state (U\_t) to another (U\_t-k).

2. **Self-Integration Upon Arrival**

   * Upon "arrival" in the past, the traveler does not persist in their current form.
   * Instead, they become the self that existed at that moment, both physically and mentally.

3. **Deterministic Loop**

   * Since the consciousness perfectly reintegrates, the events leading to time travel reoccur.
   * The act of returning to the past is written into the fabric of the timeline.
   * The loop has no beginning or end; it is a closed causal cycle.

4. **No Observability**

   * No trace is left in the origin universe.
   * No external observer sees the traveler vanish.
   * Time travel is indistinguishable from linear aging.

5. **Memory Lock**

   * Memory of previous loops is not transferred unless anomalous conditions allow it (e.g., deja vu, déjà vécu).
   * Attempts to break the loop are themselves part of the loop.

**Mathematical Model (Conceptual):**

Let:

* $C(t)$: Consciousness state at time t
* $U_t$: Universe state at time t
* $T$: Time travel event
* $\mathcal{F}(t)$: Deterministic function describing the evolution of identity and actions through time

Time travel is represented as:

$T: C(t) \rightarrow C(t-k) \in U_{t-k}$

Upon transition:

$C(t-k) = \mathcal{F}(U_{t-k})$

And by deterministic identity evolution:

$\mathcal{F}(U_{t-k}) = C'(t-k) \rightarrow \text{Time travel recreated at } t' > t-k \rightarrow T \text{ repeats}$

The cycle condition is:

$\exists\ k \in \mathbb{Z^+} \text{ such that } T(C(t)) = C(t-k), \text{ and } C(t-k) \rightarrow T(C(t))$

This implies:

$T^n(C(t)) = C(t - nk), \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

No entropy is lost or gained in the subjective consciousness state since time is a looped series of fixed universes.

**Philosophical Consequences:**

* **Free Will is Illusory**: All decisions are pre-encoded and recursively executed.
* **No Origin Point**: There is no first instance of the loop; existence is emergent from the loop itself.
* **No Escape**: Any attempt to change or break the loop is part of the deterministic script.
* **Observer Dependency**: From within the loop, it appears linear. From outside (hypothetical higher-dimensional observation), the loop is a static object.

**Conclusion:**
TILT reframes time travel from a paradox-generating anomaly into a consistent self-sustaining architecture. Conscious identity is reabsorbed into a previous universal snapshot, leading to a closed temporal recursion that explains the absence of observable time travelers, the persistence of history, and the illusion of memory-driven agency. In the TILT model, time travel is not liberation from the present—it is an eternal return to a predestined self.

**Basicly leading you to get reset back to the state you were in when you were 5(more of a snapshot of our universe in time). Since all of your actions are already in place in the future; you are forced to return back to 25, remake a time machine, and going back to when you were 5. This creates a time loop in which you can not escape but will never notice what you have done. This would explain why when "Time travelers" go "back in time" they are considered dead since they practically just disappear.**
